# Architecture {#architecture}

SnapOtter is a monorepo managed with pnpm workspaces and Turborepo. It deploys as a 3-container Docker Compose stack: the SnapOtter app image, PostgreSQL 17, and Redis 8.

## Packages {#packages}

### `@snapotter/image-engine` {#snapotter-image-engine}

The core image processing library built on [Sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/). It handles all non-AI operations: resize, crop, rotate, flip, convert, compress, strip metadata, and color adjustments (brightness, contrast, saturation, grayscale, sepia, invert, color channels).

This package has no network dependencies and runs entirely in-process.

### `@snapotter/ai` {#snapotter-ai}

A bridge layer that calls native and Python ML runtimes. Most Python tools use a persistent dispatcher that pre-imports heavy libraries (PIL, NumPy, MediaPipe, rembg) so subsequent calls skip the import overhead. OCR is isolated from that mutable shared environment: `fast` invokes native Tesseract, while `balanced` and `best` use a dedicated persistent JSONL dispatcher pinned to the active immutable RapidOCR/ONNX generation. Each request holds a generation lease. Activation first runs a smoke test on a candidate, then atomically switches to its dispatcher. The prior dispatcher drains before its generation is garbage-collected.

**Models are not pre-loaded.** Each tool script loads its model weights from disk at request time and discards them when the request finishes. See [Resource footprint](#resource-footprint) for the full memory profile.

Supported operations: background removal (rembg/BiRefNet), upscaling (RealESRGAN), face blur (MediaPipe), face enhancement (GFPGAN/CodeFormer), object erasing (LaMa ONNX), OCR (Tesseract and RapidOCR with PP-OCR ONNX models), colorization (DDColor), noise removal, red eye removal, photo restoration, passport photo generation, transparency fixing (BiRefNet HR-matting), and content-aware resize (Go caire binary).

Python scripts live in `packages/ai/python/`. Large optional model packs are installed on demand into the persistent `/data/ai` volume. Accurate OCR uses signed, platform-specific artifacts; the built-in Tesseract tier requires no model-pack download.

### `@snapotter/shared` {#snapotter-shared}

Shared TypeScript types, constants (like `APP_VERSION` and tool definitions), and i18n translation strings used by both the frontend and backend.

## Applications {#applications}

### API (`apps/api`) {#api-apps-api}

A Fastify v5 server exposing 254 tool routes across five modalities (image, video, audio, PDF, file) that handles:
- File uploads, temporary workspace management, and persistent file storage
- User file library (`user_files` table): a saved edit is stored as an independent new file by default, or as a parent-linked version when you overwrite the original. It records which tools were applied (`toolChain`) and gets an auto-generated thumbnail for the Files page
- Tool execution (routes each tool request to the image engine or AI bridge)
- Pipeline orchestration (chaining multiple tools sequentially)
- Batch processing with concurrency control via BullMQ job queues (pools: image, media, ai, docs, system)
- User authentication, RBAC (admin/user roles with a full permission set), API key management, and rate limiting
- Teams management - admin-only CRUD; users are assigned to a team via the `team` field on their profile
- Runtime settings - a key-value store in the `settings` table that controls `disabledTools`, `enableExperimentalTools`, `loginAttemptLimit`, and other operational knobs without redeploying
- Custom branding and runtime preferences through database-backed settings
- Scalar/OpenAPI documentation at `/api/docs`
- Serving the built frontend as a SPA in production

Key dependencies: Fastify, Drizzle ORM (pg-core, node-postgres), Sharp, BullMQ, ioredis, Zod for validation.

The server handles graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT: it drains HTTP connections, stops BullMQ workers, shuts down the Python dispatcher, and closes the database connection.

### Web (`apps/web`) {#web-apps-web}

A React 19 single-page app built with Vite. Uses Zustand for state management, Tailwind CSS v4 for styling, and Lucide for icons. Communicates with the API over REST and SSE (for progress tracking).

Pages include a tool workspace, a Files page for managing persistent uploads and results, an automation/pipeline builder, and an admin settings panel.

The built frontend gets served by the Fastify backend in production, so there is no separate web server in the Docker container.

### Docs (`apps/docs`) {#docs-apps-docs}

This VitePress site. Deployed to Cloudflare Pages automatically on push to `main`.

## How a request flows {#how-a-request-flows}

1. The user picks a tool in the web UI and uploads a file.
2. The frontend sends a multipart POST to `/api/v1/tools/:section/:toolId` with the file and settings.
3. The API route validates the input with Zod, then dispatches processing.
4. For standard tools, the job is enqueued to the appropriate BullMQ pool (image, media, or docs based on modality). The in-process BullMQ worker auto-orients the image based on EXIF metadata, runs the tool's process function, and returns the result.
5. For most AI tools, the TypeScript bridge sends a request to the persistent Python dispatcher. Fast OCR instead invokes Tesseract, and accurate OCR starts the pinned executable from the active immutable OCR generation. The requested OCR tier is fixed at ingress and is never silently changed during execution.
6. Job progress is persisted to the `jobs` table in PostgreSQL so state survives container restarts. Real-time updates are delivered via SSE at `/api/v1/jobs/:jobId/progress`.
7. The API returns a `jobId` and `downloadUrl`. The user downloads the processed file from `/api/v1/download/:jobId/:filename`.

For pipelines, the API feeds the output of each step as input to the next, running them sequentially.

For batch processing, the API uses BullMQ flows with per-step child jobs and returns a ZIP file with all processed files.

## Resource footprint {#resource-footprint}

SnapOtter is designed for low idle memory use. Nothing is preloaded or kept warm at startup.

### At idle {#at-idle}

The Node.js/Fastify process, PostgreSQL, and Redis are running. Typical idle RAM is **~200-300 MB** across all three containers (Node.js process, Postgres, and Redis). No Python process, no model weights in memory.

### What starts, and when {#what-starts-and-when}

| Component | Starts when | Memory while active |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Fastify server + Postgres + Redis | Container start | ~200-300 MB total |
| BullMQ workers | Container start (in-process) | One worker per pool (image, media, ai, docs, system) |
| Python dispatcher | First AI tool request | Python interpreter + pre-imported libraries (PIL, NumPy, MediaPipe, rembg) - no model weights |
| AI model weights | During the specific tool's request | Loaded from disk, freed when the request finishes |

### Model loading {#model-loading}

All model weight files (totalling several GB) sit on disk in `/opt/models/` at all times. Each AI tool script loads only its own model(s) into memory for the duration of a request, then releases them. Some scripts explicitly call `del model` and `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` after inference to ensure memory is returned immediately.

There is no model cache between requests. Running the same AI tool back-to-back reloads the model each time. This keeps idle memory near zero at the cost of a model-load delay on every AI request.

### First AI request cold start {#first-ai-request-cold-start}

The Python dispatcher is not running when the container starts. The first AI request triggers two things in parallel: the dispatcher starts warming up in the background, and the request itself falls back to a one-off Python subprocess spawn. Once the dispatcher signals ready, all subsequent AI requests use it directly and skip the subprocess spawn cost.
